# Nord for Slack

The version of Nord for Slack on the official website is for Slack pre-design refresh. The new refresh accepts more colors than the previous version so this is the setup that I have been using. Below, one color is #FF0000. As of the time of writing, this value doesn't seem to be listed in the Slack GUI and doesn't seem to change anything. I made it bright red so I should know to change it if I figure out if and where the value is used.
